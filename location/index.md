## Rio de Janeiro

_“Cradle of samba and beautiful songs / That live in our souls”_ ([Cidade Maravilhosa, by André Filho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKBukXgT_ps))

Rio de Janeiro, known as the “Marvelous City,” is one of the most iconic cities in Brazil and one of the most famous tourist destinations in the world. From the Corcovado, where the statue of Christ the Redeemer stands, to Copacabana beach, “Rio” enchants with its stunning landscapes. Founded in 1565 by Estácio de Sá, the city was the capital of Brazil from 1763 to 1960 and continues to be an important economic and cultural center: it is the second-largest metropolis in the country.  Furthermore, the Carioca people are known for their hospitality and joy, making the city even more welcoming and vibrant.

## UFRJ
The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://ufrj.br/en/)) was founded in 1920 by President Epitácio Pessoa.  Initially named the “University of Rio de Janeiro,” UFRJ brought together the fields of Engineering, Medicine, and Law by incorporating three higher education institutions that preceded it: the Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification, and Drawing (founded in 1792), the National Faculty of Medicine (1808), and the National Faculty of Law (1891). Consistently ranking among the best universities in Brazil, UFRJ currently offers 176 undergraduate programs and 232 master's and doctoral programs across its various teaching and research centers. Notably, the Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute of Graduate Studies and Research in Engineering (COPPE) is the largest engineering research center in Latin America.
