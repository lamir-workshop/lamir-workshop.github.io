Carlos Cancino-Chacón is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of
Computational Perception at Johannes Kepler University Linz (JKU), Austria, and
the Principal Investigator of the Rach3 Project, funded by the Austrian Science
Fund. The Rach3 Project uses computational, data-driven methods to study
long-term music rehearsal, leveraging advances in AI and machine learning. He
previously conducted research at the Austrian Research Institute for Artificial
Intelligence (OFAI) and was a Guest Researcher at the RITMO Centre, University
of Oslo. His research focuses on machine learning models for understanding music
performance and listening, with emphasis on three areas: computational modeling
of expressive performance, (real-time) human-computer interaction in music, and
cognitively plausible machine listening. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from
JKU, an MSc in Electrical and Audio Engineering from Graz University of
Technology, a Bachelor’s in Physics from UNAM, and a Bachelor’s in Piano
Performance from the National Conservatory of Music of Mexico. He currently
serves as a Member-at-Large on the ISMIR Board and as Section Editor for TISMIR.
