Martha E. Thomae is a postdoctoral research fellow for the ECHOES project at the
NOVA University of Lisbon, where she leads the development of tools to
facilitate the search and analysis of chants encoded in the MEI music format.
She has a PhD and Masterâ€™s in Music Technology from McGill University. During
her time at McGill, she worked as a research assistant for the Single Interface
for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project, directed by Ichiro
Fujinaga.

Most of her research has focused on the preservation and encoding of early music
written sources through music information retrieval technologies. Her PhD
dissertation focused on digitizing and encoding Guatemalan polyphonic choirbooks
from the colonial period, written in mensural notation, using optical music
recognition, automatic voice alignment, and computational error detection. She
currently serves as a Co-chair of the Mensural MEI IG
and has served as a member of the MEI Board.
