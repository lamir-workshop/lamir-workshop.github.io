As Head of Machine Learning at MusicAi, I manage a team focused on advancing
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) through machine learning. I work on developing
models for key detection, chord recognition, beat and downbeat tracking, and
source separation for audio stems and lyrics transcription. My role involves
overseeing data collection projects, aligning our research with product
requirements, and guiding the technical implementation and deployment of these
models. This experience has allowed me to bridge research and practical
application, contributing to more precise and accessible music technology tools.
