This keynote delves into the path from Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
research to practical applications, highlighting source separation as a pivotal
technology. With a background in machine learning and sound engineering, I will
discuss the journey of developing and deploying state-of-the-art source
separation models, addressing the unique challenges of making these models
accurate, efficient, and accessible to a broad user base.

A core focus will be on optimizing source separation models for real-time,
low-latency edge deployment. Iâ€™ll explore the technical intricacies of ensuring
these models perform reliably on mobile and constrained devices, where resource
limitations challenge both speed and fidelity. Topics will include the
trade-offs and design considerations in model compression, latency reduction,
and maintaining separation quality. This deep dive will illustrate how we bridge
the gap between research and real-world use, making advanced audio separation
tools available for musicians, producers, and listeners on-the-go.

Attendees will gain practical insights into the evolving landscape of MIR
technology, as well as strategies for overcoming the complexities of real-time
deployment, positioning source separation as a powerful, accessible tool in
modern music technology.
