The music program will feature the [Cuarteto
Colibriyo](https://colibriyo.uy/en/) guitar quartet, a group that cultivates the
rich tradition of guitar quartets from the RÃ­o de la Plata region, particularly
Uruguay. Cuarteto Colibriyo performs tangos, waltzes, and milongas with
arrangements by Pablo Rey.  For this event, the quartet will present a selection
of milongas by two iconic Uruguayan artists: Alberto Mastra and Alfredo
Zitarrosa, the latter renowned for his deep association with guitar quartet
accompaniment. This milonga repertoire is the culmination of three projects
funded by the Uruguayan Ministry of Education and Culture, the most recent one
developed in collaboration with the [Alfredo Zitarrosa Archive](http://www.zitarrosa.org/).
