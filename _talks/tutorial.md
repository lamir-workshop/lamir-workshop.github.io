During the first day, we will feature a tutorial-hackathon-demo featuring a a
hands-on session focused on MIR applications in Latin American music.
Participants will have the opportunity to work with Latin American datasets and
develop AI tools and data loaders that contribute to the MIR and Music-AI
community. The results of this work will be shown to the other participants in
the demo session.
