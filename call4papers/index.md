## Deadline
Tuesday, September 3, 2024, at 11:59 PM, Anywhere on Earth (AOE, UTC-12) on
Microsoft CMT.

## Overview and Topics
The Organizing Committee of the Latin American Music Information Retrieval
(LAMIR) Workshop 2024 welcomes you to submit an application to present at the
event in the form of a full paper. We encourage submissions of research from all
areas related to music information retrieval (MIR), including, but not limited
to, machine learning, signal processing, and computational musicology (see more
topics below).

The workshop is open to everyone, though we prioritize works authored by members
of the Latin American community and those centered on Latin American musical
styles. Therefore, while papers focused on Latin American music are not
required, they are highly encouraged. This new event will be an excellent
opportunity to connect with other researchers in the field while making a
meaningful contribution to improving Latin American representation in MIR.

Relevant topics for LAMIR include, but are not limited to:
* Applications in Latin American Music
* Music performance analysis
* Audio archiving, preservation and restoration
* MIR Fundamentals, Methodology, and Tasks
* Generative Tasks (Music and Audio Synthesis)
* Evaluation, Datasets, and Reproducibility
* Philosophical and Ethical Discussions
* Human-centered MIR
* Computational Musicology
* Music Recommender Systems
* Tools for Creativity

## Selection Process

#### Paper Review
All submitted papers will be reviewed using a double-blind process. Authors
should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should
not know the name(s) of the author(s).

#### Evaluation Criteria
Papers will be reviewed using the same criteria outlined by the ISMIR
organization. The workshop is open to everyone, though we prioritize works
authored by members of the Latin American community and those centered on Latin
American music.

## Submission Procedure

All paper submissions must be made through Microsoft CMT by the deadline in
order to be considered for review.

#### Subject Area
When submitting, authors will be required to choose from a list of subject
areas. Please indicate the most appropriate subject area for your work so that
we may assign reviewers accordingly.

#### Presenting Authors
At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop.
Failure to enroll before the author registration deadline will result in the
automatic withdrawal of the paper from the workshop proceedings and program.

#### Publication
Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings and on an
open-access repository using a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
License (CC BY 4.0), in accordance with ISMIR guidelines.

## Submission Requirements

#### Language
Papers should be written in English.

#### Paper Format
Papers must be formatted using the ISMIR 2024 templates (LaTeX/Overleaf or
Word). Authors are required to submit their papers in PDF format. Submissions
that manipulate the template (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) may be
rejected without review. All fonts must be embedded within the PDF.

#### Paper Length
Papers must follow a 4+N format. That is, they can contain up to 4 pages of
scientific content (including figures and tables) and any additional pages that
contain only references and an optional ethics statement. Papers should not
contain appendices. Non-PDF supplementary materials (e.g., audio) may be
uploaded in the corresponding field in the CMT submission form. Papers that do
not conform to the required length and format will be rejected without review.
Acknowledgments (optional) may be included in the camera-ready submission only.

#### Author Anonymity
Do not put the authors’ names under the title. Avoid using phrases such as “our
previous work” when referring to earlier publications by the authors. Check
supplementary material for information that may reveal the authors’ identity.
Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. To preserve the
double-blind review process, please avoid posting the manuscript on public
websites (e.g., arXiv) or promoting the work in any way (e.g., social media,
mailing lists) during the review period.
