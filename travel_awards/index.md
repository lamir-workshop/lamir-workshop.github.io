# Travel Awards

<br>
The Latin American Music Information Retrieval (LAMIR) workshop is intended to provide opportunities to local students and researchers to connect and cultivate the MIR/AI community in Latin America. Thanks to the generous support of our **[sponsors](../sponsors)**, we will be offering financial support in the form of travel awards to local Latin American student authors of _accepted_ papers so that they may attend the workshop at a limited expense.

Applicants must meet the following criteria to be considered for an award:
* They must be an author of a paper or demo that was accepted to LAMIR 2024.
* They must be enrolled in a degree-granting university or college program in the 2024-25 academic year.

Applicants will be asked to provide verification of enrollment. This confirmation can be submitted in the form of an enrollment certification document, official/unofficial transcript, a signed letter by a faculty advisor, etc. If you are unsure whether your form of documentation is acceptable, please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:lamir.workshop@gmail.com">lamir.workshop@gmail.com</a>.

Please note that the information provided in the application will be used only for determining award eligibility and reporting aggregate data. Award recipients' names will not be published unless otherwise explicitly approved.

The travel award application deadline is **23:59 on Friday, October 25, 2024 (AOE, UTC-12)**.

Award applicants will be notified of the decision by Friday, November 4, 2024. We ask that applicants please wait to register for the workshop until notifications have been sent out.
