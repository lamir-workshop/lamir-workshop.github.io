# Code of Conduct

<br>
The open exchange of ideas, freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to LAMIR's goals. This requires a community and environment that recognizes and respects every person's inherent worth. This Code of Conduct (CoC) aims to outline expected standards of behavior for all events and communication channels associated with LAMIR.

### Scope

This CoC applies to all LAMIR activities, including, but not limited to:

* LAMIR in-person events
* Correspondence sent through communication channels associated with LAMIR, such as email, social media, or instant messaging
* Meetings and discussions associated with LAMIR activities

If an activity is conducted in cooperation with another organization, and the other organization has its own CoC, the union of both CoCs applies.

### Responsibility

All attendees, speakers, mentors, panelists, sponsors, contractors, organizers, volunteers, and members of the LAMIR administrative team (referred to as “Participants” collectively throughout this document) involved in LAMIR activities as described above are required to comply with this CoC. Sponsors are equally subject to this CoC. In particular, sponsors should not use images, activities, or other materials that reinforce gender stereotypes or are of a sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature at LAMIR events.

### Unacceptable Behavior

LAMIR is dedicated to providing all participants with an experience free from harassment, bullying, discrimination, and retaliation. This includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), politics, technological choices, or any other personal characteristics or considerations made unlawful by federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or regulations. Inappropriate or unprofessional behavior interfering with another participant’s full engagement will not be tolerated. This includes bullying, intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, sustained disruption of talks or other events, sexual harassment, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, public vulgar exchanges, derogatory name-calling, or diminutive characterizations, all of which are unwelcome in this community. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior, is also considered harassment. No use of images, activities, or other materials that are of a sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature that may create an inappropriate or toxic environment is permitted. Disorderly, boisterous, or disruptive conduct, such as fighting, coercion, theft, damage to property, or any mistreatment of or unprofessional behavior towards other participants, is not tolerated. Scientific misconduct, including, but not limited to, fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism of paper submissions or research presentations, is prohibited.

### Reporting

If you have concerns related to your participation or interaction at a LAMIR activity, observe someone else in distress, or have any other comments regarding a violation of the CoC that you wish to share, you can make a report:

* Anytime by email at <a href="mailto:lamir.workshop@gmail.com">lamir.workshop@gmail.com</a>.
* In-person to organizers, volunteers, or any member of the LAMIR administrative team during an event; they will then direct you to the designated responder(s) for that event

Please note that there is no deadline by which one must make a report.

### Enforcement

Any participant asked by any member of the community to stop any prohibited behavior is expected to comply **immediately**. A response of “just joking” will not be accepted; behavior can be considered harassment without an intent to offend.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this CoC, LAMIR reserves the right to take appropriate action, including, but not limited to:

* Issuing formal or informal warnings
* Barring or limiting continued attendance and participation, such as expulsion from the event
* Banning participation in or reception of benefits from future LAMIR activities
* Excluding the offender from LAMIR opportunities, e.g., leadership, organizing, volunteering, speaking, reviewing, sponsoring, etc.
* Reporting the incident to the offender’s local institution or funding agencies.
* Reporting the incident to local authorities or law enforcement.
* Pursuing other action(s) as deemed appropriate for the situation being addressed.

The same actions may be taken toward any individual who engages in retaliation or who knowingly makes a false allegation of harassment.

### Ongoing Review

The LAMIR team welcomes feedback from the community on this CoC policy and procedures; please contact us by email at
