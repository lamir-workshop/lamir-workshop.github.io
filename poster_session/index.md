# Poster Presentations for LAMIR Workshop

Authors of each accepted paper must bring a printed poster to the workshop,
which will be used for discussions during the poster sessions.

Poster sessions are interactive events where authors present their research
visually on posters. These sessions allow for direct interaction between authors
and attendees, fostering in-depth discussions and feedback. Attendees can walk
around, view the posters, and engage with the authors to ask questions and
discuss the research. Additionally, authors may use their laptops to run demos
or show examples.

The final PDF version of the poster should be uploaded to the CMT platform by
**November 25, 2024 (AoE)**.
