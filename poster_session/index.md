# Poster Presentations

<br>
Authors of each accepted paper must bring a **printed** poster to the workshop,
which will be used for discussions during the poster sessions.

Poster sessions are interactive events where authors present their research
visually on posters. See some examples of posters from ISMIR 2024 [here](https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/papers.html?filter=keywords&search=).
These sessions allow for direct interaction between the authors
and attendees, fostering in-depth discussions and feedback. Attendees can walk
around, view the posters, and engage with the authors to ask questions and
discuss the research. Additionally, authors may use their laptops to run demos
or show examples related to their paper.

The final PDF version of the poster should be uploaded to Microsoft CMT as
**Supplementary Material** by **December 2, 2024 (AoE)**.
